# Weekend Redux Feedback Loop

__Duration: 2 Days__

## Description

In this repo, we created a reflection/feedback survey form. There are four parts to the survey: how you are feeling, your level of understanding, how much support you feel you have, and any additional comments you may have. All of the data is compiled together onto a review page, where you can look over your answers. Once done, you can then submit, saving your feedback in the database.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Express
- React
- Redux

## Installation

1. Create a database named `prime_feedback`
2. The queries in the `data.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
